#+title: Wirepas Flutter Example Application
#+author: marcel@clever.design

* Remarks
- *You need a Wirepas License* with the binary image files for building this app
- The Makefile does not work on Windows, as I use symlinks for out of tree build in WM-SDK (I use a Linux based system, but it should also work with the apple thing)

* Build
- do a recursive clone of this repository
- add wirepas binary image files to [[file:wm-image/][wm-image]] folder
- change the location of your gcc toolchain in [[./config.mk][./config.mk]]
- run ~make build~ followed by a ~make flash~ in the root directory
